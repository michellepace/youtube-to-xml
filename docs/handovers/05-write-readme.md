# Instructions for README Creation

I need you to create a professional README.md for my YouTube-to-XML project. Please:

1. **Test all installation methods** to ensure they actually work:
   - Global CLI tool installation 
   - Development setup
   - Any other relevant methods

2. **Write a clear but concise README** inspired by this style: https://github.com/michellepace/text-analyser/blob/main/README.md
   - Not overly verbose (as this example is) but clear and easy for users
   - Include installation options that you've verified work
   - Show basic usage examples
   - Include development setup
   - Format for readabilty

3. **Project context**: 
   - UV packaged application that converts YouTube transcripts to XML
   - CLI tool called `youtube-to-xml`
   - Located at: https://github.com/michellepace/youtube-to-xml
   - Uses Python 3.13+, UV for package management
   - Has entry point: `youtube-to-xml = "youtube_to_xml.cli:main"`

4. **Verify everything works** - don't just write documentation, test that the installation steps actually function correctly.

Please read the project files first to understand the functionality, then test installations, then write the README.
