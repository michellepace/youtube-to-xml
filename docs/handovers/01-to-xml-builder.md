# XML Builder Module Handover

## Current Situation
- **Branch**: `feature/xml-builder` 
- **Status**: XML builder module implemented but requires manual user testing before begin commited

## What Was Just Completed
The XML builder module (`src/youtube_to_xml/xml_builder.py`) has been implemented with test coverage (`tests/test_xml_builder.py`). This is the second deliverable in the 4-module architecture:

1. âœ… `parser.py` - COMPLETE (merged to main)
2. ðŸŽ¯ `xml_builder.py` - IMPLEMENTED (current work, needs manual testing - see section "Next Steps")
3. ðŸ”² `file_handler.py` - Not started
4. ðŸ”² `main.py` - Not started

## Project Architecture Context
This is a YouTube transcript to XML converter that:
1. Parses transcript text files to extract chapters with timestamps
2. Converts chapter data to structured XML format  
3. Outputs XML files for better LLM comprehension of video content

The XML builder is the transformation layer between parsed chapter data and the final XML output format.

### Integration Point
The XML builder consumes `list[Chapter]` objects from the parser module and produces XML strings ready for file output. The Chapter dataclass has:
- `title: str`
- `start_time: str` 
- `content_lines: list[str]`

## Key Files in This Handover

### `src/youtube_to_xml/xml_builder.py`
- Contains `chapters_to_xml(chapters: list[Chapter]) -> str`
- Uses ElementTree API exclusively (per SPEC.md requirements)
- Handles XML escaping automatically
- Pure function, no side effects

### `tests/test_xml_builder.py` (`pytest` v. 8.4.1)

**Status**
- Tests XML structure, escaping, formatting, parseability
- Uses fixtures and parametrization

**Verification still required**
- Is there significant duplication or overlap that can be simplified?
- Is the test suite over engineered with parametrization and/or fixtures?
- Are tests brittle?
- Are tests mostly independent?
- Are tests clearly and coherantly named
- Are tests logically ordered, similar to say `tests/test_parser.py` (but adapted obviously)

## Next Steps

1. Verification of automated tests (see section "### `tests/test_xml_builder.py` (`pytest` v. 8.4.1)") - **AWAIT CONFIRMATION ONCE YOUR ASSESMENT IS COMPLETED**

2. Verify that current implementation satisfies relevant success criteria in `SPEC.md` as well as design principles

3. Review and update project documentation to reflect XML builder completion:
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` project status (parser âœ… â†’ parser âœ… + xml_builder âœ…)
   - Update `docs/SPEC.md` success criteria checkboxes for XML functionality
   - Ensure documentation accurately reflects current implementation status

6. Commit the XML builder module

7. Ask for confirmation from Michelle to create PR for feature/xml-builder

8. Merge to main after review

9. Move to file_handler.py implementation

## Commands for Testing
- Run tests: `uv run python -m pytest tests/test_xml_builder.py -v`
- Lint check: `uv run ruff check`
- Full test suite: `uv run python -m pytest`
