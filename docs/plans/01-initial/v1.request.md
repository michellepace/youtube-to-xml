# Request Plan V1 (instruction for claude code to plan)

I want you to plan the first deliverable for this YouTube transcript to XML converter. Focus on:

**1. First Deliverable Scope:**

- What's the smallest working piece that demonstrates core functionality?
- Use TDD approach - write tests first

**2. Manual Verification:**

- How can I test this myself beyond just running pytest?
- What specific commands should I run to verify it works?

**3. Architecture Preview:**

- Suggest module names following 'one module, one purpose'
- Don't over-engineer - keep it simple

**4. Reference the existing working code in @scripts/transcript_reporter.py for proven regex, patterns, and Chapter dataclass**

**Key constraints:**

- Follow the @docs/SPEC.md requirements (think hard about architecture, design, TDD)
- Use the detection rules and XML template exactly as specified
- Build on UV package structure that's already set up

## Why This Works

This instruction gives Claude:

- **Clear scope boundary** (first deliverable)
- **Verification method** (manual testing steps)
- **Architecture guidance** (module names, simplicity)
- **Existing code reference** (transcript_reporter.py)
- **Concrete constraints** (SPEC.md compliance)

It avoids asking Claude to plan everything while still getting the essential structure to start building.
