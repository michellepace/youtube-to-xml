The intention of the CLI is to use either a transcript.txt argument or a <youtube_url> argument. From a API service perspective as mentioned in @README.md, in my Next.js app I plan to give uses the first option of simply inputting the URL and as a fallback (e.g. rate limiting) they can upload a transcript file (copied from the YouTube page and pasted into a file). 

Please review each of my questions:

<questions>
## Q1. Module Renaming(?)
Since `parser.py` only parses contents of files.
1. renamed `parser.py` to `file_parser.py`
2. Within the module renamed function `parse_transcript` to `parse_transcript_text`
3. I ran all tests and they are passing and ran the CLI too with a `transcript.txt` file

I am undecided if this change TO help me decide what to use:
1. Please map out the module flow of running CLI both by file and then youtube_url arguments.
   - First with the current names as detailed in @PLAN-auto.xml and @REVIEW.md
   - Then with the new names I have suggested
   - Review both options and provide a recommendation and state your reasoning

## Q2. API Services: anything currently implied?
In terms of this being an API service and what is exposed currently
- Is there any information in @README.md that details this already or implied by our current code?
- Does the @PLAN-auto.xml detail anything with regards to this?

## Q3. APPI services: what makes sense to expose?
What makes sense to expose in the API, what is clearest and best practice?
- A) Does it makes sense to have one exposed service, where the logic is within the code?
- B) Does it make sense to have two exposed services, one for files and for youtube_url?
- What is the impact of either choice (A) and (B)?
- What do you recommend?

Then deeply think about my questions and answer each in reference to the files mentions and this code base. Consider all in light of the current direction of PLAN-auto.md.

Provide a well structured answer to each of my questions. Then include a final summary of your recommendations with reasoning.
