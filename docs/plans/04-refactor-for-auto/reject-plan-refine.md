NO - Not ready to code yet.

**Please ultrathink:**

## Know the existing solution first:
Analyse the current codebase architecture thoroughly:
- all files in @src/
- @tests/test_integration.py (which will need to be refactored to NOT use the script)
- If useful other tests in @tests/
- Of course the script itself too @scripts/transcript_auto_fetcher.py

## Plan Requirements Missing

**Detailed Implementation Plan Needed:**
- Where are the key deliverable phases I requested?
- Do you have enough detail to actually implement this?
- Each phase must be testable and independent

## Architecture Requirements

**Dual Input Support:**
- Support both YouTube URL and manual file input
- Analyze current main app + script to identify commonalities
- Consider approaches: separate parsers (`parser_file.py`, `parser_youtube.py`) feeding common pipeline, or unified data format approach, or other architectures
- Evaluate what should be separated vs shared

**Core Design Principles:**
- TDD approach - write tests first, then implement
- Clear, well-named modules with single responsibilities  
- Functions easy to test independently
- No code duplication
- API-ready architecture (not just CLI)

**Essential Features:**
- Logging built in from start (supports future API + helps CLI debugging)
- No additional scripts - refactor into main application
- Maintain current functional output: structured XML from transcript data

## Deliverable Structure Needed

Provide a phased plan with:
1. **Phase objectives** - what gets delivered with completion tracking e.g. "[ ]" and "[x]"
2. **Module breakdown** - specific files/functions
3. **Testing approach** - how to validate each phase
4. **Integration points** - how phases connect
5. **Success criteria** - success criteria for end to end refactor with tracking  e.g. "[ ]" and "[x]"

Propose the best approach rather than assuming a specific solution, remember the `<guidelines>` too as a start for code design and code quality.
