# Comparing Architectual Designs

Design comparision: [1-explore-a_R.md](2-explore-a_R.md) vs [2-explore-b_R.md](2-explore-b_R.md)

Manually compared first
- Which do I understand easily
- Which looks more testable
- Which looks more elegant
- where do I mind duplication, where don't I
- Chose: [2-explore-b_R.md](2-explore-b_R.md)

Opus compared (cleared context)
- Got it to explain "good system design"
- Give it the objective: *"Integrate the experimental script's YouTube transcript functionality into the main application using clean architecture. The experimental script will be deleted after integration."*
- Analyse each design, identify 5 critical evaluation criteria
- Write a report
- Repeat: swap design docs around to ensure its not positional bias
- Opus chose: [2-explore-b_R.md](2-explore-b_R.md)

End result:
1. Selected [2-explore-b_R.md](2-explore-b_R.md)
2. Cleared context
3. Opus independent evaluation of [2-explore-b_R.md](2-explore-b_R.md) â†’ output: [4-chose-B.md](4-chose-B.md)
