# Request Plan V2 (instruction for claude code to plan)

I want you to plan the first deliverable for this YouTube transcript to XML converter.

Carefully analyse file @docs/SPEC.md. Pay deep attention to the architecture, design, and TDD. Understand the problem. 

Now Focus on:

## Solution Architecture Preview
- Suggest module names following 'one module, one purpose'
- Don't over-engineer - keep it simple
- Explain the purpose of each module in prose (3-5 sentences)
- Draw an ASCII drawing to show the "Flow" (keep it high level)

## First Deliverable Scope
- Which module makes sense to work on first, explain why?
- Explain how this module will abide to the design and architecture in @docs/SPEC.md
- What's the smallest working piece that demonstrates core functionality?
- Use TDD approach - write tests first, ensuring to order in the same order as logical implementation. Remember, these tests will drive out implementation (later)

### Manual Verification
- How can I test this myself beyond just running pytest?
- What specific commands should I run to verify it works?

## Review
Review your architecture solution at a high level. what do you like about it and what could be better. 

## Output
Well structured addressing the above and with the plan for the first deliverable. Emojies.
