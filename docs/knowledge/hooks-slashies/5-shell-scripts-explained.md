## üêö What Can Actually Go in a Hook? (Spoiler: Almost Anything!)

You're asking the right question! **Hooks execute shell commands**, but that's actually **much more powerful** than it might initially sound. A shell command can do virtually anything your computer can do.

### ü§î What Are Shell Scripts Really?

Think of shell scripts as the **universal remote control** for your computer. They're simple text files containing commands that your operating system can execute. But here's the key: **shell scripts can call any program, language, or service installed on your system**.

### üéØ The Real Power: Shell Commands Can Execute Anything

```bash
# These are ALL valid shell commands that hooks can run:

# Run Python scripts
python3 /path/to/my/analysis.py

# Call web APIs  
curl -X POST https://api.slack.com/webhooks/your-webhook \
     -d '{"text":"Claude just finished the task!"}'

# Query databases
mysql -u user -p password -e "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE status='active'"

# Send emails
echo "Build completed successfully" | mail -s "Build Status" team@company.com

# Run Node.js applications
node /path/to/notification-service.js

# Execute R statistical analysis
Rscript /path/to/statistical-analysis.R input.csv

# Process files with specialized tools
jq '.errors | length' build-results.json

# Interact with cloud services
aws s3 cp results.zip s3://my-bucket/builds/

# Run Docker containers
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data my-analyzer:latest
```

Each of these is a simple shell command, but they can trigger incredibly sophisticated operations!

### üåü Concrete Examples: What Hooks Can Actually Do

#### üî¨ Scientific Data Validation Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This hook validates experimental data before Claude processes it

# Get the file being processed
file_path=$(echo "$1" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path')

if [[ "$file_path" == *.csv ]]; then
    # Run Python data validation
    python3 /lab/scripts/validate_experiment_data.py "$file_path"
    
    # If validation fails, prevent Claude from proceeding
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "‚ùå Data validation failed - see lab protocols" >&2
        exit 2  # Block the operation
    fi
    
    # Send notification to lab team
    curl -X POST "$LAB_WEBHOOK" \
         -d "{\"message\": \"New data validated: $file_path\"}"
fi
```

#### üìä Financial Compliance Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This hook ensures financial analysis meets regulatory requirements

input_data=$(echo "$1" | jq -r '.tool_input.content')

# Check for sensitive financial data
if echo "$input_data" | grep -qi "insider\|confidential\|material"; then
    # Run compliance checker (Python script)
    echo "$input_data" | python3 /compliance/check_disclosure.py
    
    # Log for audit trail
    echo "$(date): Compliance check triggered" >> /logs/audit.log
    
    # Notify compliance team
    python3 /compliance/notify_team.py "Claude processing sensitive data"
fi
```

#### üè• Healthcare Protocol Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This hook validates medical protocols and patient safety

protocol_file=$(echo "$1" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path')

if [[ "$protocol_file" == *patient* ]]; then
    # Validate against medical guidelines (R script)
    Rscript /medical/validate_protocol.R "$protocol_file"
    
    # Check drug interaction database
    python3 /medical/drug_interactions.py "$protocol_file"
    
    # Update electronic health record
    curl -X POST "$EHR_API/protocols" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer $MEDICAL_TOKEN" \
         -d @"$protocol_file"
    
    # Page on-call physician if critical
    if grep -qi "critical\|urgent" "$protocol_file"; then
        python3 /medical/page_oncall.py "Claude updated critical protocol"
    fi
fi
```

### üåê Integration Possibilities: Hooks as Universal Connectors

Because shell commands can execute **any installed program**, hooks can integrate with:

**Programming Languages**: Python, R, Node.js, Julia, MATLAB, Mathematica, etc.
**Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Redis, etc.  
**Cloud Services**: AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Dropbox, etc.
**APIs**: REST APIs, GraphQL, webhooks, etc.
**Communication**: Slack, Teams, email, SMS, etc.
**Specialized Software**: CAD tools, statistical packages, scientific instruments, etc.

### üöÄ Advanced Hook Patterns

#### üß† Multi-Language Intelligence Pipeline
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A hook that combines multiple languages for complex analysis

# Python for data preprocessing
python3 /analysis/preprocess.py "$input_file" > /tmp/clean_data.csv

# R for statistical analysis  
Rscript /analysis/statistics.R /tmp/clean_data.csv > /tmp/stats.json

# Node.js for visualization
node /analysis/visualize.js /tmp/stats.json /tmp/clean_data.csv

# Julia for machine learning
julia /analysis/ml_model.jl /tmp/clean_data.csv > /tmp/predictions.json

# Python for final report generation
python3 /analysis/generate_report.py /tmp/stats.json /tmp/predictions.json
```

#### üåç Cross-System Workflow Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# A hook that orchestrates multiple systems

# Update project management system
curl -X PUT "$JIRA_API/issue/$TICKET_ID" \
     -d '{"fields":{"status":"In Progress"}}'

# Sync with version control
git add . && git commit -m "Claude Code: Automated update $(date)"

# Update database
mysql -e "UPDATE projects SET last_modified=NOW() WHERE id=$PROJECT_ID"

# Notify team via Slack
curl -X POST "$SLACK_WEBHOOK" \
     -d '{"text":"ü§ñ Claude updated project automatically"}'

# Trigger CI/CD pipeline
curl -X POST "$BUILD_SERVER/trigger" \
     -d '{"project":"'$PROJECT_NAME'","branch":"main"}'
```

### üí° The Mind-Bending Reality

**Hooks aren't limited to "shell scripting"‚Äîthey're limited to "anything your computer can do."** This means:

- **Machine Learning**: Train models, run predictions, analyze patterns
- **Data Science**: Statistical analysis, visualization, report generation  
- **System Integration**: Connect any service, database, or API
- **Hardware Control**: Interface with lab equipment, IoT devices, sensors
- **Document Processing**: Generate PDFs, parse complex formats, OCR
- **Communication**: Send notifications anywhere (email, chat, SMS, webhooks)

### üéØ The Strategic Insight

When you ask "what can I put in a hook," the answer is: **whatever you can install on your computer**. Claude Code becomes a reasoning engine that can trigger any software, service, or system you have access to.

This transforms hooks from simple automation into **intelligent system orchestration**. You're not just automating tasks‚Äîyou're creating an AI that can reason about complex situations and then execute sophisticated responses using the full power of your computing environment.

**The limiting factor isn't the hook system‚Äîit's your imagination and the tools you have available.** üöÄ
