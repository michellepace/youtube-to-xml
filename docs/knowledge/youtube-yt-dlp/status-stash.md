# Code Review: URL to Transcript Script Issues

Looking at your current changes in `scripts/url_to_transcript.py` and comparing them to our findings in `temp.md`, I have concerns about committing the current changes as-is.

## Current Issues with Your Changes:

### 1. Incomplete Error Handling

Your current changes only handle HTTP 429 detection in the subtitle processing phase (lines 146-153), but our investigation revealed:
- Bot protection errors occur during video metadata extraction (line 137: `ydl.extract_info()`)
- Current code would still crash unhandled on bot protection scenarios

### 2. Missing Bot Protection Detection

The current code only looks for "HTTP Error 429" and "429" patterns, but doesn't handle the actual error you encounter:
- **Missing:** "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" detection
- **Result:** Bot protection will still cause unhandled crashes

### 3. Wrong Error Classification Location

Based on our testing, invalid URLs (scenarios 4-7) should be caught and classified as `URLVideoNotFoundError`, but there's a bug around the `extract_info()` call.

## My Recommendation: DON'T COMMIT YET

The current changes are partially correct but incomplete. Committing now would:
- ✅ Fix genuine HTTP 429 rate limiting (good)
- ❌ Still crash on bot protection (bad)
- ❌ Still crash on invalid URLs (bad)

## What You Should Do:

1. Either revert the current changes and implement a complete solution
2. Or add a commit message indicating this is "partial implementation - bot protection handling still needed"

The investigation in `temp.md` shows we need a more comprehensive approach that handles errors at the `extract_info()` level, not just `process_info()` level.
